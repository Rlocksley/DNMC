#DNMC
This is an implementation of a Feed Forward Network which uses another Feed Foward Network as an external Memory


#DNMC^2
This is an implementation of a Feed Forward Network which uses a DMNC as its external Memory


the .train() methode generates random sequences between 0 and 1 , and trains the Network for the copy function.




I don't have more calculation power than to test it on  the copy function but this test worked really well.

Pease feel free to test it and write me how it works on other problems.

I think especially DNMC^2 could have a potential.
